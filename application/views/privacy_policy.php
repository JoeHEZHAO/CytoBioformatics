                        <h6>2. What Is Personal Information?</h6>
                        <p>The term “personal information” means information that specifically identifies an individual or enables others to contact an individual (such as a name, address, telephone number, mobile number, e-mail address, or credit card number).

Personal information does not include “aggregate” information, which is data we collect about the use of the Site or Service or about a group or category of services or users, from which personal information has been removed. This Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information.</p>
